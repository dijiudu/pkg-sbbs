Debian TODO for Synchronet

Packaging:
- Edit debian/control as initial version
- Edit debian/copyright as initial version
- Edit debian/README.Debian for initial version
- Rename manpage.1 as synchronet.1 & edit as base man page for package
- create man pages for executables. (see if can do some from existing docs?)
 -use sym links to the 'undocumented' manpage until can get the others written?
- create manpages file to list all of the man pages to be installed. 

Librarys:
- Add source of crytplib, instead of using precompiled library.  Need both for
being able to do non i386 packages as well as just being neccessary for package
to be accepted into Debian.   Haveing a separate cyrptlib package would enable
it to be used for syncterm, although could also have a synchronet-common package
to handle that.

Configuration:
- Prompting for some initial configuration options at installation ? (from Ragnarok)
 -hostname and sysop info (like system password) 
 -ports or services that you want to run. 
 -dove-net setup?
 -bbs service start at system startup?
