Debian TODO for Synchronet

Packaging:


[	Do this during the build?
    # Also exclude or delete afterwards the directory web/root/telnet/tools.
]

[	use a patch, or a cmd in debian/rules, to do this.
    # Delete web/root/images/nightshade/Thumbs.db (Unneeded and it causes a Lintian warning.)
]

[	use a patch, or chmod in debian/rules, to take care of this

    # Correct the file permissions on the file ircd.conf
chmod 644 ctrl/ircd.conf
    # Correct the file permissions on the file sync_pbgj1_grey_bg.gif
chmod 644 web/root/images/default/sync_pbgj1_grey_bg.gif

]

[	Use a patch to do this

    # Correct the first lines of the files exec/gnats_cvs.js and exec/sendmail.js to 
    # as follows:  "#!/opt/synchronet/exec/jsexec -x -c /opt/synchronet/ctrl"
]
    
[	Use a patch to do this

    # On line 116 of src/sbbs3/GNUmakefile:   Change "$(PWD)/$LIBODIR)" to
    # "$(SBBSDIR)/exec".  Remove the string "$(PWD)/" from the other three
    # instances of it on that line.  Those setup a more correct rpath in 
    # the executables than that set by a regular compile & install.
    # (Does assume that SBBSDIR is set at that point.)
]

- Reference http://vert.synchro.net/msgs/msg.ssjs?msg_sub=syncanno&message=25
  for a messsage posted by DM regarding: "a bug in the v3.14a SCFG.EXE that
  causes crashes when deleting message and file areas".  Find where he fixed
  that in the code and use a patch to correct it for the debian package. 

- Build-Depends on libmozjs-dev is currently versioned (= 1.9.0.19) because SBBS
  builds on a lenny system using the debian libmozjs package but fails on a squeeze
  system which uses a later version of the package.   Add note about the dependancy
  to the debian readme or news file, noting that it is available on debian v5(lenny).

- Create man pages for executables. (see if can do some from existing docs?)

- Warnings by package checker (lintian) about RPATH setting in binaries?  If
  still present, add to overrides.

- Separate packaging for sbbs apps (sbl, sbj) to be installed to exec/xtrn?
  This would allow for separate packaging for any similar extensions.

- Separate packaging for web templates, like for sbbs apps? 

- Create a synchronet-dbg package?   (Check references.)  

- Edit, adding what's neccessary for gtk programs;  possibly add as separate
  package?

- The Java Telnet Applet (jta) is already a standard packaage in Debian:
  investigate the use of that version of jta, instead of the version that is
  distributed with synchronet.  

- Debian ITP # 418776, after resolve non-free zmodem issue?

Configuration:
- Prompting for some initial configuration options at installation ? (from
  Ragnarok) hostname and sysop info (like system password), ports or services
  that you want to run, dove-net setup?, bbs services start at system startup?
  Anything that is configurable in the *.ini files could possibly be updated
  using a program.  (Perl script?)
- Create & use debian/po if use debconf messages, so they can be translated.

Libraries:
- Add usage of libsdl?  (libsdl1.2-dev, libsdl1.2debian-all?)

- Add source compilation of cryptlib, instead of using precompiled library.
  Need this both for being able to do non i386 packages as well as just being
  neccessary for the package to be accepted into Debian.   Haveing a separate
  cryptlib package would enable it to be used for syncterm, although there could
  also be a synchronet-common package to handle that.
