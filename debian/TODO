Debian TODO for Synchronet

Packaging:
- Add a call to the baja makefile in exec into the postinst script?
- At least for package purge;  delete /opt/synchronet/exec/*bin ?
- Create man pages for executables. (see if can do some from existing docs?)
- debian/control:  Description - Add a note about the BBS shells that it can
  emulate?  Add note about scripting languages available/usable?
- Warnings by package checker (lintian) about RPATH setting in binaries?  If still
  present, add to overrides.
- Separate packaging for sbbs apps (sbl, sbj) to be installed to exec/xtrn?  This would
  allow for separate packaging for any similar extensions.
- Separate packaging for web templates, like for sbbs apps? 
- Create a synchronet-dbg package?   (Check references.)  
- Edit, adding what's neccessary for gtk programs;  possibly add as separate package?
- The Java Telnet Applet (jta) is already a standard packaage in Debian:  investigate the use
  of that version of jta, instead of the version that is distributed with synchronet.  
- Debian ITP # 418776, after resolve non-free zmodem issue?

Configuration:
- Synchronet user:group - sbbs:sbbs  Configure automatically at installation.   
- If ~/text & ~/web are not present, automatically copy from installation directory.
- Prompting for some initial configuration options at installation ? (from Ragnarok)
  hostname and sysop info (like system password), ports or services that you want to run,
  dove-net setup?, bbs services start at system startup?  Anything that is configurable
  in the *.ini files could possibly be updated using a program.  (Perl script?)
- Create & use debian/po, so that debconf messages can be translated.

Libraries:
- Add usage of libsdl?  (libsdl1.2-dev, libsdl1.2debian-all?)
- Add source compilation of cryptlib, instead of using precompiled library.  Need
  this both for being able to do non i386 packages as well as just being neccessary
  for the package to be accepted into Debian.   Haveing a separate cryptlib package
  would enable it to be used for syncterm, although there could also be a
  synchronet-common package to handle that.
