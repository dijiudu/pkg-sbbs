Debian TODO for Synchronet CVS

Packaging:
- Find better way of passing the results of uname -m to the dh_install lines in debian/rules;
  tried defining a variable but couldn't get that to work.  Define it completely outside of 
  the target rule?
- Even if the actual build is using the files from the dev packages for libnspr4 & libmozjs,
  the rpath is getting set to the ones from the build system instead of where the libararies
  are actually installed on a Debian system.  Set the library paths, per the syncunix.txt doc.
- Add a call to the baja makefile in exec into the postinst script?
- Create man pages for executables. (see if can do some from existing docs?)
- debian/control:  Description - Add a note about the BBS shells that it can
  emulate?  Add note about scripting languages available/usable?
- Separate packaging for sbbs apps (sbl, sbj) to be installed to exec/xtrn?  This would
  allow for separate packaging for any similar extensions.
- Separate packaging for web templates, like for sbbs apps? 
- At least for package purge;  delete /opt/sbbscvs/exec/*bin ?
- Create a sbbscvs-dbg package?   (Check references.)  
- Edit, adding what's neccessary for gtk programs;  possibly add as separate package?
- The Java Telnet Applet (jta) is already a standard packaage in Debian:  investigate the use
  of that version of jta, instead of the version that is distributed with Synchronet.  

Libraries:
- When installed on a system where it was not compiled & an attempt is made to start it, sbbs
  cannot find the libsbbs.so library file, which is installed in /opt/sbbscvs/exec.
- Warnings by package checkers (lintian, linda) about RPATH setting in binaries.
  Can that be defined at compile time? (search keywords RPATH, disable-rpath)  They could be
  deleted/changed using chrpath cmd before building the package...
- "dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: format of libcl.so not recognized".  Also get the same for the 
  following libraries:  libsbbs.so, libftpsrvr.so, libwebsrvr.so, libmailsrvr.so, & libservices.so.
  That is an issue with the _name_ of the library file rather then with the file itself.  Esp. seems
  to expect a version number in a particular format as part of the name. 
- Add usage of libsdl?  (libsdl1.2-dev, libsdl1.2debian-all?)
- Add source compilation of cryptlib, instead of using precompiled library.  Need
  this both for being able to do non i386 packages as well as just being neccessary
  for the package to be accepted into Debian.   Haveing a separate cryptlib package
  would enable it to be used for syncterm, although there could also be a
  sbbscvs-common package to handle that.

Configuration:
- Names for sbbscvs user:group?  sbbscvs:sbbs?   
- Create & use debian/po, so that debconf messages can be translated.
- ctrl*/, text/*, web/*, data/*: debian packages only install/update to /usr/share/sbbscvs.
  Add debconf questions about if to copy to runtime directory instead of manually setting it?
- Prompting for some initial configuration options at installation ? (from Ragnarok)
  hostname and sysop info (like system password) 
  ports or services that you want to run. 
  dove-net setup?
  bbs services start at system startup?
