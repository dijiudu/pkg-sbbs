Debian TODO for Synchronet

Packaging:

- Edit, adding what's neccessary for xtrn/sbj
- Edit, adding what's neccessary for builtin usage of dosemu
- Edit, adding what's neccessary for gtk programs;  possibly add as separate package?
- separate packaging for sbbs apps (sbl, sbj) to be installed to exec/xtrn?  This would
  allow for separate packaging for any similar extensions.
- separate packaging for web templates? 
- Edit debian/synchronet-default;  Add cmd for "SBBSCTRL=" here?
- Names for user:group?  synchronet:sbbs  ?
- Add "SBBSCTRL=" to ~/.bash_profile ? Any other environment variables?
- Create man pages for executables. (see if can do some from existing docs?)
- debian/control:  Description - Add a note about the BBS shells that it can
emulate?  Add note about scripting languages available/usable?
- text/*: debian package only installs/updates to /usr/share/synchronet/text.  Add debconf question
about if to copy to install directory, & if so to where?
- web/*: debian package only installs/updates to /usr/share/synchronet/web.   Add debconf question
about if to copy to install directory, & if so to where?

Libraries:
- Symlink of libcl.so to libcl.so.3.3.0 so only have to install one of them?
- Add source compilation of crytplib, instead of using precompiled library.  Need
this both for being able to do non i386 packages as well as just being neccessary
for the package to be accepted into Debian.   Haveing a separate cyrptlib package
would enable it to be used for syncterm, although there could also be a
synchronet-common package to handle that.

Configuration:
- Set startup files so that sbbs is not started automatically until it has been specifically
  enabled to do so;  this helps ensure that an attempt to start it is not done until after
  it has been configured. 
- Create & use debian/po, so that debconf messages can be translated.
- Prompting for some initial configuration options at installation ? (from Ragnarok)
  hostname and sysop info (like system password) 
  ports or services that you want to run. 
  dove-net setup?
  bbs services start at system startup?
