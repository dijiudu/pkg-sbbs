Debian TODO for Synchronet

Packaging:

- Edit debian/rules, adding what's neccessary for installation
- docs/images is being installed to the main doc directory instead of to
  a sub-directory of it.
- Edit debian/rules, adding what's neccessary for 'make clean'
- Edit debian/init.d; correct path of sbbs to that actually being used,
- Edit debian/synchronet-default; correct daemon opts ref to match that
used in init.d.  Add cmd for "SBBSCTRL=" here?
- Should scfg be put in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin or /usr/lib/synchronet? (menu = /usr/bin...)
- Names for user:group?  synchronet:sbbs  ?
- Add "SBBSCTRL=" to ~/.bash_profile ? Any other environment variables?
- Edit debian/NEWS.Debian for initial version
- Create man pages for executables. (see if can do some from existing docs?)
- debian/control:  Description - Add a note about the BBS shells that it can
emulate?  Add note about scripting languages available/usable?

Libraries:
- Add source of crytplib, instead of using precompiled library.  Need this both for 
being able to do non i386 packages as well as just being neccessary for the package
to be accepted into Debian.   Haveing a separate cyrptlib package would enable
it to be used for syncterm, although could also have a synchronet-common package
to handle that.

Configuration:
- Prompting for some initial configuration options at installation ? (from Ragnarok)
  hostname and sysop info (like system password) 
  ports or services that you want to run. 
  dove-net setup?
  bbs services start at system startup?
