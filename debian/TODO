Debian TODO for Synchronet

Packaging:
- Names for user:group?  sbbs:sbbs? synchronet:sbbs  ?
- Createing a synchronet-dbg package?   (Check references.)  
- Create man pages for executables. (see if can do some from existing docs?)
- Edit, adding what's neccessary for built in usage of dosemu
- Edit, adding what's neccessary for gtk programs;  possibly add as separate package?
- debian/control:  Description - Add a note about the BBS shells that it can
  emulate?  Add note about scripting languages available/usable?
- separate packaging for sbbs apps (sbl, sbj) to be installed to exec/xtrn?  This would
  allow for separate packaging for any similar extensions.
- separate packaging for web templates? 
- find better way of passing the results of uname -m to the dh_install lines in debian/rules;
  tried defining a variable but couldn't get that to work.  Define it completely outside of 
  the target rule?
- At least for package purge;  delete /usr/lib/synchronet/*bin.
- The Java Telnet Applet (jta) is already a standard packaage in Debian:  invesitgate the use
  of that version of jta, instead of the version that is distributed with synchronet.  

Libraries:
- Warnings by package checkers (lintian, linda) about RPATH setting in binaries.
  Can that be defined at compile time? (search keywords RPATH, disable-rpath)
- "dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: format of libcl.so not recognized".  Also get the same for the 
  following libraries:  libsbbs.so, libftpsrvr.so, libwebsrvr.so, libmailsrvr.so, & libservices.so.
  That is an issue with the _name_ of the library file rather then with the file itself.  Esp. seems
  to expect a version number in a particular format as part of the name. 
- Add source compilation of cryptlib, instead of using precompiled library.  Need
  this both for being able to do non i386 packages as well as just being neccessary
  for the package to be accepted into Debian.   Haveing a separate cryptlib package
  would enable it to be used for syncterm, although there could also be a
  synchronet-common package to handle that.

Configuration:
- While still using the precompiled version of libcl, a symlink to the versioned file
  needs to be put in /usr/lib
- node directorys need to be at the base of the sbbs dir? rather than in the data dir?
- Either install something to /etc/synchronet or put it in debian/dirs
- Create & use debian/po, so that debconf messages can be translated.
- ctrl*/, text/*, web/*: debian packages only install/update to /usr/share/synchronet.
  Add debconf questions about if to copy to runtime directory, & if so to where? /srv/sbbs?
- Prompting for some initial configuration options at installation ? (from Ragnarok)
  hostname and sysop info (like system password) 
  ports or services that you want to run. 
  dove-net setup?
  bbs services start at system startup?
