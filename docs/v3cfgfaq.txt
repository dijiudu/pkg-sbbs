Q: I want to create custom menus. Is there any detailed documentation or
   samples regarding custom menus on Synchronet?  
A: Yes, see the customization chapter in the Synchronet Sysop Manual
   (http://synchro.net/docs/customization.html), the Baja Manual
   (http://synchro.net/docs/baja.html), or Synchronet JavaScript page
   (http://synchro.net/docs/js.html) for details.

Q: I seem to missing the menu files for non-default (Synchronet Classic)
   command shells on v3.10L-win32.
A: These files were accidentally excluded from the v3.10L-win32 install.
   Download ftp://vert.synchro.net/Synchronet/menu.zip and extract (with
   directories) into your Synchronet text/menu directory.

Q: How do I get on the Synchronet BBS List (http://synchro.net/sbbslist.html)?
A: The best way is to first join DOVE-Net, then run the Synchronet BBS List
   (SBL) door on *your* BBS and add an entry for your BBS. This entry should
   be automatically exported to the DOVE-Net SYNCDATA echo which will then be
   propagated to Vertrauen and every other BBS on DOVE-Net. The sbbslist.html
   page is automatically generated on Vertrauen every night at midnight
   (Pacific time), so wait a day or so for your entry to appear on the list.
   If it doesn't appear, verify that that your BBS entry was properly
   exported (as a message) to the SYNCDATA message area. The events that run
   SMB2SBL and SBL2SMB to import and export BBS entries should be configured
   by default. If they are not, see xtrn/sbl/sbl.doc for more details.

Q: How do I get my BBS listed in the Instant-Message capable BBS list
   (ftp://ftp.synchro.net/sbbsimsg.lst)?
A: First get your BBS on the Synchronet BBS List (sbbslist.html), and if your
   BBS is running the Synchronet SMTP server on port 25 (like it should) and
   the Synchronet Finger Service on TCP and UDP port 79, your BBS should
   automatically appear in the instant message list. If it is not, then
   verify that your SMTP and Finger services can be reached remotely (the
   ports aren't being blocked by a firewall or your ISP).  This list
   is generated nightly on Vertrauen at the same time as the Synchronet BBS 
   List (http://synchro.net/sbbslist.html).
   See docs/imsgdocs.txt for more details.

Q: How do I know what ports Synchronet needs opened through my firewall?
A: The answer depends on what Synchronet servers and services you have enabled
   and whatever ports you have configured Synchronet to use for each.

   The default port values for Synchronet servers and services are:
   Telnet: 23 (TCP)
   RLogin: 513 (TCP)
   FTP: 21 (TCP)
   SMTP: 25 (TCP)
   POP3: 110 (TCP)
   NNTP: 119 (TCP)
   Gopher: 70 (TCP)
   Finger: 79 (UDP and TCP)
   HTTP: 80 (TCP)
   IRC: 6667 (TCP)

   You can check your configured port values in ctrl/sbbs.ini and services.ini.

Q: How do I join DOVE-Net?
A: If you've installed v3.10, Telnet to vert.synchro.net and create a new
   account for your QWKnet transfers (using your system's QWK-ID for the user
   name), then edit your "Call-out Command Line" in SCFG->Networks->QWK->Hubs
   ->VERT: replace "YOURPASS" with the password you used when creating your
   QWKnet user account. Do NOT change anything else in the command-line!
   That's it! For more details, see docs/dove-net.txt.

Q: What is my system's QWK-ID?
A: This is normally an abbreviation of your BBS's name that YOU determine
   and configure in SCFG->Message Options. You may want to look at NODES.DAT
   in DOVE-NET.ZIP for any conflicts with other DOVE-Net systems' QWK-IDs.

Q: How do I get my FTP server to work behind my firewall/NAT/router?
A: See http://www.ncftpd.com/ncftpd/doc/misc/ftp_and_firewalls.html for
   details.

Q: How do I disable the New User Feedback requirement?
A: In sbbs v3.10-win32, run the Configuration Wizard and un-check the
   "Require new user feedback" checkbox. Otherwise, set SCFG->Nodes->Node 1
   ->Advanced Options->Validation User to "0".

Q: What is the "!QWKTOMSG failed" or "Duplicate message" warnings in my 
   Telnet/Event log while importing DOVE-Net QWK packets into my message 
   areas?
A: This warning indicates a duplicate message in your QWK packet was detected. 
   Duplicate messages in the SYNCDATA echo are normal and you can disable the 
   duplicate message checking for that echo in SCFG->Message Areas->DOVE-Net
   ->SYNCDATA and the warnings should go away.

Q: How do I join/setup a FidoNet Technology Network (FTN)?
A: Use SBBSecho (included with Synchronet) to toss (export) and scan (import)
   your FidoNet bundles, packets, and NetMail (see
   http://synchro.net/docs/sbbsecho.html for details).

   You will also need a TCP/IP FTN transport program like Binkd, Internet Rex,
   Argus, Beemail, etc. Traditional Front-End Mailers (FrontDoor, InterMail,
   D'bridge, BinkleyTerm, etc) are NOT normally used for TCP/IP-based FTN
   transfers.
   See http://net229.darktech.org/fidosetup/ for instructions on setting up 
   Synchronet with the Argus 32-bit FidoNet mailer for Windows.
   I, personally, use Binkd for Win32 or Unix/Linux, which you can find
   available for download on Vertrauen and the docs (what little there are)
   online and example setup in docs/binkdex.html.

Q: How do I import newsgroups into my board.
A: Synchronet v3.10 comes with NewsLink, an external JavaScript module for
   importing and exporting messages via NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol).
   See docs/newslink.txt for details.

Q: How do I keep external programs (doors) from popping up windows and
   stealing the keyboard/mouse focus (Windows)?
A: Check SBBSCTRL:Telnet->Configure->Minimize Externals.

Q: How do I set additional nodes for telnet access (Windows)?
A: Create the additional nodes in SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure->Nodes if you
   haven't already done so (Version 3 uses the same configuration information
   from the first telnet node for all telnet nodes and the COM port/modem
   configuration information is ignored). Set SBBSCTRL:Telnet->Config->Last
   Node to highest node number you want available for telnet logins.

Q: How do I add files to the file database?
A: The easiest way is to use the ADDFILES utility which can automatically
   detect and import embedded descriptions (e.g. FILE_ID.DIZ). See the
   chapter in the sysop manual on "Adding files" and the ADDFILES utility
   chapter for details. No, a files.bbs list is not necessary for adding
   files. Use "ADDFILES * /DIZ" to search all directories for a new files.bbs,
   import any embedded descriptions (e.g. FILE_ID.DIZ), and delete the file.bbs
   after importing it. If you don't have a file list (e.g. files.bbs) to import
   just use "ADDFILES * /SZN" to search all directories for new files and use
   embedded (FILE_ID.DIZ) description files, if they exist.

Q: Long filename support doesn't seem to be fully functional.
A: Support for files with long filenames (greater than the MS-DOS 8.3 format)
   is a work in progress. There are two main issues:
   A: The current Synchronet file database format only supports 8.3 filenames.
   B: The only X/Y/Zmodem file transfer program that currently works with 
      Synchronet-Win32 is FDSZ, which is a 16-bit DOS programs (which therefore 
      only supports 8.3 format filenames).
   Synchronet v3.10 will display long filenames, but the files must be added to
   the database using a means other than X/Y/Zmodem (at this time).
   The file database format is being replaced in v3.20 and will store long
   filenames as well as many other improvements.
   There is work being done to create a good 32-bit Winsock alternative to FDSZ
   that will support long filenames as well as consume less resources.

Q: How do I enable forced upload/download ratios.
A: By default, Synchronet utilizes a "credit" system, where a user typically
   earns credits by uploading files, posting messages, playing online games, 
   etc. And downloading files requires a number of credits based on the size
   of the file.

   If you prefer to use a less flexible upload/download "ratio" system, you
   can do so by using the UDR (upload/download byte ratio) or UDFR
   (upload/download file ratio) ARS keywords in the Download Requirements of
   your file areas. These ARS keywords, like the PCR (post/call ratio) keyword
   use a specified minimum "percentage". So if you wish to enforce a 1:3
   upload/download ratio, then use "UDFR 33" for 33%, 3:4 ratio would be
   "UDFR 75" for 75%, 1:2 would be "UDFR 50" for 50%, etc.
   See http://synchro.net/docs/security.html for details on using ARS.

Q: How do I allow users to send Internet e-mail from the BBS?
A: See http://synchro.net/docs/message_section.html for details.

Q: How do I disallow connections from specific host names or IP addresses 
   (or ranges).
A: Add the disallowed host names to your text/host.can file or IP addresses
   to your text/ip.can file. To disallow a range of IP addresses, use the ^
   wildcard character (e.g. "192.168.10.^"). To disallow a partial string in a
   host name, use the ~ wildcard character (e.g. "mofoisp.com~").
   in Synchronet v3.10+, you can use the familiar '*' wildcard character
   (e.g. "*.aol.com" and "192.168.*").

Q: My CPU/kernel-utilization meter reports 100% when a user is online and
   entering a string/line of text.
A: Set SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure->Nodes->Node X->Toggle Options->Low Priority
   string input to "Yes" (where X is your first telnet node).

Q: How do I allow anonymous logins to the Synchronet FTP Server?
A: You need to create a Guest account on your BBS. Create a new user (login
   as "New" or use the User Editor included with v3.00b) with a user name of
   "Guest". Give this user the 'G' exemption and the 'G', 'M', and 'F'
   restrictions and delete the password for the account. You may also want
   to give the Guest account additional exemptions (e.g. L, P, T, etc).
A: Or preferably, run the exec/makeguest.js script included with v3.11+.

Q: How can I get door X to work?
A: If the door wasn't specifically written to run on Synchronet (XSDK) or
   WWIV BBS Software (typically using CHAIN.TXT), then it must support FOSSIL
   communications (most popular doors support FOSSIL) and the door must be
   configured to use a FOSSIL driver (yes, you'll need to read the door's
   documentation files).
   The Synchronet FOSSIL driver is automatically configured and loaded when
   needed and ignores the COM port information used by doors, so configuration
   details such as COM port number and baud rate are irrelevant (you can just
   leave them set to their default values if the door configuration program
   allows them to be changed, or use COM1/38400 if it makes you happy).

Q: How can I get this FOSSIL door to work?
A: Make sure you have "Intercept I/O Interrupts" set to "No" for all FOSSIL
   doors in SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure->External Programs->Online Programs
   (this includes Synchronet Match Maker v2.x).
   Make sure you have the appropriate startup directory, command line, and
   drop file options set in SCFG. See SBBSDOOR.TXT for specific instructions
   on setting up some popular door games (i.e. LORD, BRE, GlobalWar, TW2002).
   Make sure you DO NOT have any FOSSIL drivers loaded (including X00, BNU,
   ADF, COM/IP, WinFOSSIL, or NetModem) as they will conflict with
   Synchronet's FOSSIL driver.
   Make sure the door supports FOSSIL communications (read the door's docs)
   and that the door is configured to use a FOSSIL driver. Synchronet's
   FOSSIL driver is automatically configured and loaded when needed - there
   is nothing you need to do to install or load the Synchronet FOSSIL driver.

Q: SyncEdit isn't working correctly.
A: See the docs/syedtfaq.txt for details.

Q: When I read messages on my v2.3c (or earlier) nodes, I sometimes get a
   garbled Message Attributes line.
A: Synchronet v3 introduced a new message attribute (REPLIED) and this
   attribute is not currently supported in v2.3c. To work around this problem,
   remove one of the %s's from the MsgAttr line of your CTRL\TEXT.DAT file.
   I plan on releasing a v2.3d with this fix (and others) in the future).

Q: I have Scroll-Lock on, but I'm still not available for chat page.
A: Synchronet version 3 no longer uses Scroll-Lock to indicate sysop
   availability. Instead, there is a button on the SBBSCTRL tool bar and on
   the BBS menu to toggle the sysop availability for chat (added in v3.00b).

Q: Is there any updated documentation for Synchronet v3?
Q: The documentation I have (sysop.doc) appears to be for v2.3 for DOS/OS2?
Q: Do you have documentation that is easier for me to view/print/etc?
A: Yes, the documentation included in Synchronet v3.00b was the same old
   SYSOP.DOC (ASCII text file) created for Synchronet for DOS and OS/2 v2.30.
   It was reformatted in HTML and updated for version 3.00c (as of
   December 2000). You can view the progress of the Synchronet Documentation 
   project at: http://synchro.net/docs. Contributors are welcome!
   The Synchronet HTML docs have been converted to PDF for your
   viewing/printing pleasure and can be downloaded @ vert.synchro.net.

*** OLD (ver 3.0) ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ***

Q: The SBBSCTRL:BBS->Login menu option isn't working for me.
A: The default local login command in v3.00 ("start telnet://localhost") does
   not work on NT-based OSes (including Win2K and WinXP). If you're running 
   v3.00, run REGEDIT and go into
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Swindell\Synchronet Control Panel
   and change "LoginCommand" to "telnet localhost" or "mtel localhost" or 
   whatever your favorite telnet client is.

   If you're running v3.10e or later, then the "start telnet://localhost" 
   command line should work (start up your registered telnet client).

Q: The SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure menu option isn't working for me.
A: SCFG and SCFG32 are console-mode programs that only work in an 80x25 
   console window. If you're seeing the message "USCRN failed!" that means
   you probably have your default console window set to a dimensions larger 
   than 80x25.

   You can fix this on Windows NT/2K/XP by adjusting the properties of your
   System32\command.pif file. Make sure "restore settings at startup" 
   (under the "Screen" tab) is not checked. Also, make sure the screen buffer
   size is no larger than the screen window size (80x25).

Q: How come some of the times diplayed are off by exactly one hour?
A: In v3.10, try setting SCFG->System->Toggle Options->Use Local/System Time
   Zone to "Yes". That *should* fix the problem.
A: There is a time-zone bug in the Microsoft Visual C++ run-time library I'm
   using in Synchronet v3 related to day-light savings time. Those of you
   using v3 in a timezone which has daylight savings, may see a different time
   in the BBS (ctrl-T for example) than you do in SBBSCTRL or your system tray.

   You can fix the problem by removing Windows' knowledge of daylight savings
   altogether (which I think is a dumb idea to begin with). You need to run
   TZEDIT which is included on the Win98 CD in the tools\reskit\config
   directory. It's included with Win95 OSR2 in the Admin\Apptools\Tzedit
   directory. Anyway, run tzedit, select your time-zone from the list (it
   should already be selected), click the "Edit" button, and UN-CHECK the
   "Automatically set Daylight Savings Time" check box. Then clck OK, then
   click CLOSE.

   Now, you need to RE-SELECT the time-zone by double-clicking the time in your
   system-tray (lower right corner) or by re-selecting the time zone in the
   control panel. Now when you run Synchronet and user logs on (for example),
   the times should all be correct.

Q: I get an error message that contains "file: c:\src\sbbs3\etc" or something
   similar but I do not have Synchronet installed on drive C or that path does
   not exist?
A: The "Source" or "File" portion of the error message is for the author's
   reference only and has nothing to do with your Synchronet configuration. The
   file path in question was the original source code file where the error
   occured, which you do not need to concern yourself with (unless you are
   modifying the source code). Send the ENTIRE error message (as shown in your
   data/error.log file) to the author if you still have any questions or
   concerns that aren't answered here or in the sysop documentation.

Q: My long filenames aren't appearing correctly on the BBS?
A: The Synchronet file database currently only supports the DOS 8.3 naming
   format. Longer filenames will be shown in their Micros~1 mangled form.
   The Synchronet FTP server does automatically detect and display long
   filenames, however. Long filenames will be supported in the BBS/Telnet
   server in a future release (v3.10).

Q: File transfers (DSZ) aren't working.
A: You need to use FDSZ (FOSSIL version of DSZ) in place of DSZ:
   1. Verify you have FDSZ.EXE in your Synchronet EXEC directory.
   2. Change the command lines in SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure->File Options->
      Transfer Protocols from "%!dsz ..." to "%!fdsz ...".
A: If you're using an NT-based OS (including Win2K and WinXP), you'll need
   to upgrade to v3.10e or later to get the fix for Zmodem transfers.

Q: Why do I get an SBBS.DLL error about missing GetDiskFreeSpaceEx?
A: You're attempting to run Synchronet v3.0 on pre-OSR2 Windows 95 or Windows 
   NT 3.x. Support for pre-OSR2 Windows 95 was added in Synchronet v3.00c.
   See http://www.synchro.net/platforms.html for a matrix of supported 
   platforms.

Q: Can I run version 3 under Windows NT4/2000?
A: The first beta release (v3.00a) did not include a FOSSIL/DOS interrupt
   driver for NT/2000, so only Windows 95/98 was fully supported. Version
   3.00b includes a FOSSIL/DOS interrupt driver for NT4/2000. If running under
   NT4/2000, see NTREADME.TXT for configuration details.

Q: How do I get Synchronet to create a DOOR32.SYS drop file?
A: In v3.10, you just select "Door32.sys" from the drop file list.

Q: How do I tell Synchronet that a program is 32-bit?
A: Add the program's base filename to SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure->External
   Programs->OS/2 Program List (this is actually the native 32-bit program
   list). If you specified the executable file extension (e.g. ".exe") on
   the program's command-line, then you'll also need to include the
   filename with the extension in the 32-bit Program List.
   In v3.10, you just set "Native Executable" to "Yes".

Q: What is SCFG?
A: The Synchronet Configuration Utility (exec/scfg.exe). This 16-bit 
   console/text-mode program is left-over from Synchronet v2 and is still used 
   (as of v3.0) to configure many of the aspects of Synchronet v3
   (SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure). See http://synchro.net/docs/system_config.html 
   for details.

   There is also a 32-bit version of SCFG, SCFG32.EXE, that should be used in
   place of SCFG.EXE when more than a few hundred kilobytes of memory are 
   required for configuration information (typically, for large numbers 
   of message areas). 

   You can change the program and command-line used with the 
   SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure menu option: in v3.00, run REGEDIT, and change
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Swindell\Synchronet Control Panel\ConfigCommand
   or in v3.10, go to SBBSCTRL:File->Properties. Change the string to 
   "%sSCFG32 %s" (removing the "/t2") to utilize the 32-bit version of SCFG.

   You can run SCFG/SCFG32 from the command-line by specifying the path to your
   Synchronet CTRL directory as the first parameter
   (e.g. "c:\sbbs\exec\scfg32 c:\sbbs\ctrl"). When running the 16-bit version of
   SCFG under Windows, it is highly recommended to use the "/t2" command-line
   switch to yield Windows time-slices.

   SCFG and SCFG32 only work in 80x25 text windows (on Win32-based OSes). 
   SCFG will fail with a "USCRN failed!" error message when run in a non-80x25
   window.

   ** UPDATE **
   SCFG.EXE v3.10 (included with Synchronet v3.10g and later) is 32-bit; 
   there is no more SCFG32.EXE (you can safely delete this file). Also, SCFG.EXE
   is no longer limited to 80x25 text windows.
   
   If you find SCFG is running in a Window where not all of the application is
   visible, add "-l25" to your SCFG command-line to force it to 25-line mode.

As always, see the documentation if you have any questions that aren't
answered here: http://synchro.net/docs
